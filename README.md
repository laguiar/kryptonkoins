# ![Kotlin Spring](kotlin-spring.png)Krypton Koins

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laguiar/kryptonkoins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/laguiar/kryptonkoins)

Krypton Koins is a multi cryptocurrencies portfolio monitor.

The idea is to have an app that you can use locally to monitor your tokens.

It's just a _pet project_ to be a playground for **Kotlin** and the new Spring 5 features.

## Setup
- Spring Boot 2 with Webflux and functional routing
- Kotlin 1.2.x
- Mongodb

## Todo
- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] Functional routing and handlers _(partially)_
- [ ] WebClient tests _(in progress)_
- [ ] Dockerize app + mongodb for local development/use
- [ ] Show portfolio with gains/losses per Krypton and overall situation
- [ ] Integration with Coinbase/Gdax/Bitfinex api _(delayed data)_
- [ ] Web UI
- [ ] Authentication _(maybe)_
